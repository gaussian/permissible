class PermissibleFilter(CheckViewConfigMixin, filters.BaseFilterBackend):
    """
     A filter backend that limits results to those where the requesting user
    has read object level permissions, according to policies.

    Filtering is based on the actions in the ACTION_POLICIES (either "object"
    or "global") of the model class, e.g. for a model class "surveys.Survey"
    owned by its Survey.project, we might have the following:

    ```
    ACTION_POLICIES = {
        "surveys.Survey": {
            "object": {
                "list": p(["view"], "project"),
                ...
            },
        }
    }
    ```

    Note that this filter is expected to work in conjunction with the permissions
    framework. The "list" permissions will already have been checked by default
    if you are using `PermissiblePerms`. Assertions guarantee that
    `PermissiblePerms` is being used.

    THIS FILTER DOES NOT CHECK PERMISSIONS OR FILTER DOWN TO PERMITTED OBJECTS,
    instead it relies on the ACTION_POLICIES being correctly configured to
    check permissions.

    NOTE: we do not perform filtering for detail routes.
